# holomemsguesser script

Script to find which is the best member to guess on the [holomemsguesser website](https://holomemsguesser.com/classic.html), which also evolved into finding how members are picked by the website.  
As far as my observations goes, a group of 7 members is picked every week (the same day, somewhere between Tuesday and Thursday). A member can appear in every 4 modes in the same 7-days period, but can't appear in two modes the exact same day.  
To start, simply run the ``main.py`` file.
